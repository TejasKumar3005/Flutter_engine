# Controllers

## Overview
This folder contains the controllers for the game engine. Controllers are responsible for handling the game logic, managing the state of the game, and responding to user input.

## Contents
- `game_controller.dart`: Manages the overall game state, including game initialization, pausing, and resuming.
- `player_controller.dart`: Controls the player character's actions, movements, and interactions within the game world.

## Usage
Controllers are used to separate the game logic from the view and model layers. They interact with models to update the game state and render the appropriate views.
